# Approval chains system Improved
######################################################################################################################
#The approval chains system is closely tied in with the Authorizations granted to a Role.
#Only Members who have "Message requires approval" authorization can assign approval chains when composing messages.
#Only Members who have "Can approve messages" authorization can be a part (a reviewer) of an approval chain.
#Reviewers can only see the message when it is their turn to accept/reject the message

#NOTE: We will assume a Composer and 2 reviewers for the test cases
  #where chain1 is the approval chain and utest2 and quality are the managers for approval
  #viralheattest is the member requesting for approval
#IMP : Please do not remove the comments as it is the skeleton for approval chains scenarios
